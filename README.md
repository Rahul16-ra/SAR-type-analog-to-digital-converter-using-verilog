# SAR-type-analog-to-digital-converter-using-verilog
Parameterizable N-bit SAR ADC implemented in Verilog RTL using a clean 3-block FSM architecture. Simulated in Xilinx Vivado with deterministic N×Tclk conversion timing. Analog input is abstracted as scaled digital values for RTL simulation. Verified for multiple resolutions (variable N) to demonstrate scalability and timing accuracy
